# Data-Structure Used
Used a dictionnary to save 

# Method
Dynamic programming

# How
Everytime we encounter an item in the list we substract it from the target and then we check in the dictionnary if we have encountered the result of that substraction. If no, store it with index as value and continue. If yes, you found the answer.

# How could make it faster
Check that we are not comparing an already stored key.

# Any difficulties
I know I had to choose a dictionnary, but substracting and then looking at the key was somthing I had to think about :P
