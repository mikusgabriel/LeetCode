# Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

# Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# Return k.


class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: list[int], val: int) -> int:

        write_pointer = 0
        
        for read_pointer in range(len(nums)):

            if nums[read_pointer] != val:
                nums[write_pointer] = nums[read_pointer]
                write_pointer += 1
        
        return write_pointer
